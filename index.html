				<h1>Apologies, I didn't expect company...</h1>
				<p>Thank you for checking out my portfolio! If you are here just to see my projects, you can have a look at the section to the right of this intro. You can also from here double-check anything from my CV that would merit needing receipts, such as any certificates or awards. But if you're here to learn more about me - I appreciate it! Hopefully you'll find what you're looking for!<br><br>My name is Naomi Nemo Wirén. I'm a Swedish game developer, practicing programming, games design, and games writing since 2016. Back when I moved to the UK in 2019, I had one goal: to become someone who knew what they talked about. Since then I have accomplished two degrees, taken part in multiple outreach programmes to help get university students into the games industry, and taken part in developing a product for a successful London start-up.<br><br>Outside of my feats, I am currently pursuing a rekindled passion of mine. Writing and storytelling has always interested me, and I am currently pursuing paths to become a better writer. I have in the past written stories for all manners of mediums, ranging from comedy sketches with my friends when I was in primary school, to short stories and poems in my college days. These days, I am still writing in the form of my personal book writing project, as well as learning how to adapt a story for games both through game writing courses tutored by respected writers in the games industry such as Lorne Nudel and more practically and small-scale in the hobby taking up most of my free-time: tabletop role-playing games.<br><br>Whether you are considering me for a writing position or a programming position, I promise to not let you down. I always aim to go above and beyond - this website for example was written by hand in HTML, CSS, and JQuery, despite me not having any prior experience with these languages. I hope my tenacity and willpower to ensure that whatever project I work on is as best as it can be sounds like something you would consider.<br><br>Kind regards,</p>
