			<h1>Character Work</h1>
			<p>Since 2021, I have been actively been involved in tabletop gaming, both as a game master and as a player. Over the years, I have played plenty of characters, and eventually developed a hobby for creating new character concepts with interesting backstories. As someone who visualise characters in broad strokes to further develop attributes to harkon to, these character concepts and biographies are associated with images meant to visualise the character further. These models were created by me using the online miniature designer <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/">HeroForge</a>.</p>
			
			<h1>The Farmer</h1>
			<div class="project-gallery">
				<p style="flex: 1 1 25vw">In the dreary countryside once lived a dairy farmer with his wife and son. The farmer did not have any aspirations outside of what he already had – he had worked the farm since it was his father’s, and he would work on it until it was his son’s. His life changed when his home was ravaged by creatures of the night, slaughtering his family. He too would be dead had he not been saved by forces beyond his understanding, taking form in a sinister grimoire.<br><br>Although saved, the farmer was left scarred – both physically and mentally – with no beloved, no home, and no willpower. In the defeated corners of his mind, the grimoire influenced him, introducing him to a greater power, a more sinister one than the god he once prayed to. He became infatuated with what he learned to be the truth – life and death are both machinations in a torturous game to the powers beyond. The farmer, horrified by his indoctrination, found a goal in life – to undo these machinations and let his family rest in peace.</p>

			<h1>The Shipwright</h1>
			<div class="project-gallery">
				<p style="flex: 1 1 25vw">Scout doesn’t care for her story. Her father died when she was newborn in a fight and shortly after his passing, her mother abandoned her by the docks. She was raised by the disgruntled and hardworking shipwrights of the town whom, in this environment, made her tough and orderly, but uncaring and antisocial to others her age. She often wore one of her father’s oversized jackets, and as puberty hit, she begun binding her chest to keep it out of the way.<br><br>In her teens, she became obsessed with perfecting her work, becoming an outstanding shipwright. She developed a reputation for being combative and aggressive. “A trait of her father’s”, she despised hearing but had begun to accept of herself, much like the jacket. By nightfall, she would often return to the docks, bruised and bloody. It became so common that eventually the dockworkers would not even give it a second look.<br><br>Her life changed when a kid came into town as a stowaway on a trading vessel. The boy, half Scout’s age, was a nuisance in her life the dockworkers told to care for. Eventually, the two grew close, and he would become a younger brother to her.</p>
